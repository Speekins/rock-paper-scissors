# Rock-Paper-Scissors 
______________________________________________________  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
When you are bored and looking to pass the time, what better way than to play a game of rock-paper-scissors. Better yet, no friends required! The computer will prove to be an excellent opponent.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
In order to access and clone the repository, a user can fork the repository from https://github.com/Speekins/self-care-center. From the forked repository, click the green 'code' button and copy the https link. In the local terminal, type "git clone" followed by the https link. At this stage the application can be opened in a local browser by typing in terminal "open index.html".

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am currently a student in module one. It took me about 4 days (approximately 12 hours) to complete all features seen on this app.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
1. Implementing HTML, CSS and JavaScript through an entire appication build.
2. Use HTML & CSS to replicate a given "website".
3. Capture user events to effectively create a responsive webpage (via event listeners & handlers).
4. Build individual coding skills.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
1. A significant win was being able to organize the page using CSS with relatively few headaches. This was a goal of mine because I have previous eperience with CSS, but the page layout has always proved to be the most challenging.
2. A major challenge came up with handling user input to edit the messages as they choose. I first attempted to use an attribute `contentEditable` but this was challenging because I was unsure how to capture the new data. Once I opted to use the text input for editing messages, it was smooth sailing.
